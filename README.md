# Interstellar Object Tracker (ISO) Tracking Project with Machine Learning

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project focuses on **ISO tracking** using Python and Machine Learning. It combines exploratory data analysis with predictive modeling and time-series forecasting to improve tracking accuracy and efficiency.  

The project is split into two notebooks:
1. **ISO Tracking Project.ipynb** â€“ Data preprocessing, exploration, visualization, and feature analysis.
2. **ML for ISO Tracker.ipynb** â€“ Machine learning models, time-series forecasting, and evaluation.
